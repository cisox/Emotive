# Emotive WoW Add-On

Emotive adds a simple dropdown menu for Emotes.

Quickly send an emote by simply selecting an emote from the dropdown which is organized by the first letter of the emote. Each emote gives a tooltip with information about what type of emote it is (Text, Voice, Animation, or Voice and Animation), any race restrictions for the few emotes that are restricted to a particular race (Ex: /sniff for Worgen, /moo for Tauren), and the emote text for yourself or your current target.
